Dear team at Google

I'd like to express my interest in exploring opportunities at Google as a product manager.  I believe my skills and experience can be of a good fit to the role.

Since the beginning of my career, I have been exposed to many different aspects of the technology industry.  From a global, financial understanding to product development, I have gathered understanding of internet products and technologies. 

My work at two startups also provided opportunities for me to gain product design and management experience.  In particular, by founding my own startup, I worked daily with the developer to come up with a minimal viable product. I really enjoyed translating customer feedback to product features. 

I am currently attending a full time web development course, and recently won first prize at a hackathon with a product built on python.  Upon graduation, I am keen to explore a career at Google.  

Look forward to hearing from you. 

Best
Michelle
